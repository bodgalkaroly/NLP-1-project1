The observed bias is, that the proportion of negative/postive words is fairly constant, with a higher bias towards positive words. When the document length is uniform, and hence the number of positve word occurences is relatively uniform too, then this bias can be expressed as an average of 8 more positive word occurances per document. However, with the document length varying (and hence the number of positive words varying), the proportion between the negative/postive words is constant, not their difference. While for documents with 16 positive words we expect 8 negative word (the proportion is 0.5), for a document with 32 positive words we would not expect 24 negative words, but rather 16 (the proportion of 0.5 should be constant, not the difference of 8).\n",
